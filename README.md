# mnist-classification

This repository contains machine learning implementations for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset, exploring both neural network and dimensionality reduction approaches (PCA).

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a large collection of handwritten digits widely used for training and testing in machine learning. It contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9).
Dataset characteristics:

Training samples: 60,000

Testing samples: 10,000

Image dimensions: 28x28 pixels (784 features)

Classes: 10 digits (0-9)

## Implemented Techniques
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):
- Model evaluation performance compared to logistic regression and neural network 

Logistic Regression with Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
- Compare performance trade-offs between dimensionality and accuracy

## Requirements
python >= 3.6
scikit-learn
numpy
matplotlib
tensorflow or pytorch (for MLP implementation)
jupyter notebook
pandas
seaborn
